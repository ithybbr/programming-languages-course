She spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience
Like a woman who went blind
Because she looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes
With pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about
The dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes
With a pinhole in it
